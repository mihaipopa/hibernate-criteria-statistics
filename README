Enabling Hibernate criteria statistics with AspectJ
---------------------------------------------------

Currently Hibernate statistics does not include information about
criteria queries. According to this ticket [1] all it needs to make
this work is add a method 

protected String getQueryIdentifier() { 
  return "[CRITERIA] " + getSQLString();
}

to CriteriaLoader class. As patching Hibernate itself would be rather
tedious, this projects contains an AspectJ aspect to add the method
via an inter-type declaration as well as a test to demonstrate it.
